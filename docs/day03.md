# Day 3: Finding Biggest Numbers

## Problem Description

Given a list of numbers, find the biggest and next biggest numbers with constraints.

## Part 1

Find the biggest number before the end of the list, then find the next biggest number.

### Example Input
```
[To be filled in]
```

### Example Output
```
[To be filled in]
```

### Approach
1. Find the maximum value that's not at the last position
2. Find the next maximum value (second largest overall or from remaining)

### Solution
- Answer: `[your answer]`

## Part 2

Pick through the list one by one to get the highest number, leaving enough at the end.

### Example Input
```
[To be filled in]
```

### Example Output
```
[To be filled in]
```

### Approach
Greedy approach: at each step, pick the largest number available while ensuring enough numbers remain for future picks.

### Solution
- Answer: `[your answer]`

## Notes
Part 1: Simple max finding with position constraint
Part 2: Greedy selection with lookahead constraint
